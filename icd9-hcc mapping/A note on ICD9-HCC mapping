A note on ICD9-HCC mapping

The ICD9 code suffixes were removed (anything after the ".") and de-duped; when a ICD9 parent code was mapped to
multiple conditions, we filtered to the condition having the most matches, allowing for ties.  One should be able 
to merge this dataset against the "diag_1", "diag_2", and "diag_3" fields in the admissions dataset (excluding 
anything after the "." for the ~7% of codes that have it).
