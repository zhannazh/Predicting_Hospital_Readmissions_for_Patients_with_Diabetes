In this project, I build a decision tree model to predict which inpatient visits will result in a 30-day readmission to the hospital in a sample of patients with diabetes.

- The first 2 IPython Notebooks focus on data cleaning.
- The 3rd IPython Notebook includes modeling details.
- Results are summarized in the attached PowerPoint / PDF presentation.
